# What This Project Is About
This project looks at casino machine data to understand:
1. How much money each casino location earned (GGR)
2. How GGR changed from 2024 to 2025
3. Which casinos performed well or badly
4. How much jackpot was paid
5. ROI for each casino
6. ROI = Total GGR – Total Jackpot

# Step 1: Cleaning the Data
1. Removed wrong entries like “Error”, “INVALID”
2. Fixed numbers and dates
3. Matched machines with their locations
4. Prepared clean tables for GGR and jackpot analysis

# Step 2: GGR Analysis
1. We compared GGR of 2024 and 2025 to see:
2. Which casinos earned more in 2025
3. Which casinos dropped
4. Top 10 best and worst changes
This helps to quickly see which locations are improving.

# Step 3: ROI Analysis
1. ROI tells us how much a casino keeps after jackpots are paid.
2. Since jackpot data was missing for many casinos, those casinos show:
3. ROI = Total GGR (because jackpot = 0)

# How to Run This Project
